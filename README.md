#Slack Music Notifier

This is a Google Chrome extension which will post metadata about music being played by [Google Music](https://play.google.com/), [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com/), or [Spotify](http://play.spotify.com) to a [Slack](https://slack.com/) webhook. Currently in development and can be installed to Chrome through [Chrome Extensions](chrome://extensions/) by dragging the dist/slack-music-notifier.crx file into the browser window or cloning this repo and using the Load unpacked extension... feature with Developer mode enabled.
