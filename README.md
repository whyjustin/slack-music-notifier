#Slack Scrobbler

This is a Google Chrome extension which will post metadata about music being played by [Google Music](https://play.google.com/) or [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com/) to a [Slack](https://slack.com/) webhook. Currently in development and can be installed to Chrome through [Chrome Extensions](chrome://extensions/) by dragging the dist/slack-scrobbler.crx file into the browser window. Be sure to set the appropriate Username and Webhook Address in the extension options.

**NOTE**
Spotify integration is currently broken although the configuration options are still available. You may have some success adjusting the DOM selectors in Advanced Options - YMMV.
